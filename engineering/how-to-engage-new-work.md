There are some tips I leant in my works about how to engage on the new work/team or new projects. When ramp up on the new teams/projects, we might need to have an overview quickly of the whole system and how it works internally.

There are three aspects we could follow:
1. **Understand the System Overview**: Make the effort to learn about all parts of the product and how they work together.
2. **Understand What and Why the System does**: you need to understand the internal challenges of the system and also the problems of other areas outside their own, not just the interfaces on offer.
3. **Understand How the System get Evolved**: Spend time getting historical perspective on design decisions, then you how why it system works as it is right now.

In terms of how could we achive the goals above, there are several ways:
- Design docs/team wikis
- Teammates/Experts
- Tech talk recordings
